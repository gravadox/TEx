### TEx
simple text expander ( keyboard abbreviation application) using python.

NOTE: this app has issues with languages other than english so I recommend using prefixes before the expansion
      example: "--msg1" --> "this is message number one"
      example: "--skull" --> "ðŸ’€"

encrypted categories use token stored in keyring
anything encrypted can't be restored if the token is missing, so make sure to make a copy of everything you don't want to lose
I recommend you don't modify this app files unless you know what you are doing
